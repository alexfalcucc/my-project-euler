Project Euler Problem 9
=======================

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for
which,
                             a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
"""


"""
Since pythagorean triples occur as m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2

Therefore their sum is 2m^2 + 2mn=100

m^2 + mn =500

m(m+n)=500

sqrt500=22.~~~

therefore try m=20 , m+n=25
n = 5
a = 400-25=375
b = 2*20*5=200
c = 400+25=425
