    Project Euler Problem 15
    ========================

    Starting in the top left corner of a 2 * 2 grid, there are 6 routes
    (without backtracking) to the bottom right corner.

    How many routes are there through a 20 * 20 grid?

    There is a good article with the better explanation of it bellow:

    if m == n:
